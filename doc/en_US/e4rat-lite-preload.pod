=head1 NAME

e4rat-lite-preload - Preload files into memory

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<e4rat-lite-preload>  B<[> option(s) B<]>  file(s)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

e4rat-lite-preload transfers files into memory to gain a high cache hit rate. 

In order to prevent disk seeks the preloading process is divided into two steps:

First, it reads the files' I-Node information, after it reads the files' content. This can be done in parallel of executing the command specified with --execute. If e4rat-lite-preload is executed as the init process by adding it to the kernel parameters, /usr/lib/systemd/systemd is called.

=head2 Observations

The list I<file(s)> must be in a format generated by e4rat-lite-collect.

It assumes that all files got reallocated by e4rat-lite-realloc at first. 

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item -V --version

show version information and exit.

=item -h --help

display usage message and exit.

=item -i --initfile

Alternate init file.

=item -s --startuplog

Alternate startup log file

=back

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Accelerate the boot process:

Run e4rat-lite-preload as early as possible. It is recommended to run it as the init process. To do so, append the following line to the Kernel parameters in grub(8) or lilo(8):
   init=/usr/bin/e4rat-lite-preload
